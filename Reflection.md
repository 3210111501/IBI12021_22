I didn't lose point for Practical 4.

For Practical 5

variables.py
When compare e and b, I only write one situation that is e>b, so I make up for the other two situations: e=b and e<b.
After conduct the code, I got the result that e>b.
The second question about boolean is missing. So I write a new funtion that contain four situations: X is True, y is True; x is False, y is True; x is True, y is False; x is False and y is False.
W=X+Y, only both X and Y are True, W is True.

triangle.py
It should display the first 10 values, so n should in range (1,11), not (1,10). So 55 can be dispalyed.

mystery_code.py
I didn't understand the function of this code. After run it again and again, I finally understand that this code will pick 10 integers randomly between 1 and 100, and show the last one.

pizza_party.py
I write the checking with the number of cuts required for 64 slices into other script. Now, I integrate two codes.

For Practical 6

paternal age effect.py
I creat a dictionary and make the data of different paternal age correspond to the data of their offspring, so that when the input is changed, the frequency table can match the input.
And I forgot to label the plot, so I add the labels.

list manipulation.py
Add the labels.
